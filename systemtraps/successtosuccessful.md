# Success to the successful/competitive exclusion

The rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer the best-known example of a competitive exclusion system trap. This is another feedback loop, where ‘winners’ in a system have an unfair advantage when it comes to competing for new opportunities or resources, leading to a vicious circle.

Education is an area where this trap shows itself regularly: look for evidence that [the gap between private and state school pupils going to university is widening](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/gap-england-department-for-education-government-data-b2634966.html), for example, how the use of private tutoring ["deepens inequality"](https://inews.co.uk/news/education/gcse-results-face-national-scandal-of-inequality-as-post-covid-boom-in-private-tuition-deepens-division-2567907), or the ["geographic exclusion"](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/mar/01/england-poorer-pupils-face-exclusion-from-top-state-schools-study) of poorer children from higher performing schools.

Tech is another field: in 2015 Reuters [revealed](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/amazon-copied-products-rigged-search-results-promote-its-own-brands-documents-2021-10-13/) that Amazon used its access to seller data to design its own private‑label products and "manipulat[ed] search results to boost its own product lines in India", while in 2015 *The Wall Street Journal* [used FOI to reveal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-the-u-s-antitrust-probe-of-google-1426793274) "evidence that Google’s algorithm was demoting the search results of competing services while placing its own higher on the search results page".

Focusing on **supplier vulnerability** can help expose where dominant companies may be exploiting their power. *The Guardian's* [coverage](https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2015/jun/25/tesco-supermarkets-behaving-badly-suppliers?utm_source=chatgpt.com) of the UK supermarket sector describes multiple examples, while its [reporting](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/05/supermarket-watchdog-inquiry-tesco-treatment-suppliers) notably focuses on the rules designed to prevent such exploitation, and the regulator's (lack of) power to impose effective punishment.

Broader scrutiny of **regulation** (complaints, investigations, reports, data), **tax laws** (such as taxes on inheritance but also [the use of "sweetheart tax deals for companies like Uber"](https://www.icij.org/investigations/uber-files/uber-tax-havens-dodge-drivers/)), and **anti-monopoly laws**—how often they are enforced, the effectiveness (or not) of punishments, how companies avoid those, and the need for new rules — provides another potential basis of reporting.

In sport, for example, journalists have [investigated](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2023-11-15/roman-abramovichs-hidden-football-deals-during-chelseas-time-at-the-top) how "Abramovich’s Chelsea may have secretly bypassed Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules governing world football, helping propel the club to the pinnacle of the game, at the expense of its rivals".

Other forces to consider include [first-mover advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-mover_advantage), the [“competency trap”](https://thesystemsthinker.com/using-success-to-the-successful-to-avoid-competency-traps/) (when people don't switch to alternatives because they are used to a particular product), and '**network effects**'.

- **What to look for**: Self-reinforcing inequality (e.g. funding that rewards institutions with better resources, [reviews](https://parliamentnews.co.uk/nhs-review-based-funding-plan-raises-concerns) or results), whistleblowers, network effects, regulatory effectiveness, lobbying for regulatory change, tax deals and subsidies, 'bundling' of products
- **Questions to ask**: Who controls key resources? Are newer players being excluded? What is the experience of those at the bottom of the supply chain? What complaints are being raised with regulators? What reports are produced by regulators internally?

## Monopolies outside of regulation

Laws exist to prevent monopolies - but what about industries outside of the law? The war on drugs is not only a story of policy resistance (or 'fixes that fail'), it also hands an unfair advantage to winners. As [one analysis puts it](https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/four-decades-counting-continued-failure-war-drugs): 

> "drug prohibition keeps some suppliers out of the drug market—those unwilling or unable to take the risks associated with operating in an illicit industry. Those individuals and groups that remain are those more comfortable with using violence and engaging in illicit activity. In a legal market for drugs, not only would the costs and benefits of using violence change (violence would be less attractive), but new entrants could more easily penetrate the market. Over time, monopoly power would be eroded as in other competitive markets. As such, cartels would be unlikely to form and would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to maintain.

> "higher costs tend to force out smaller producers, leaving larger producers to dominate the market. Without the resources and connections to avoid eradication efforts, smaller producers made easy targets. And by pursuing small producers, local leaders and other officials could show they were doing something to combat opium production. The result was that large producers thrived. These same producers became increasingly integrated with the Taliban, who developed a cartel over the country’s opium production.
