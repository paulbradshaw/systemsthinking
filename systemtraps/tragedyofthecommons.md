# The tragedy of the commons

**The problem of people or organisations exhausting a common resource - from overfishing and deforestation to hospital beds or public lawyers - is a recurring theme in news stories and investigations. It is so common that it has a name: the *tragedy of the commons*. In this post I'll explain how identifying this 'system trap', and using systems thinking, can help journalists spot these stories, and tell them better.**

The tragedy of the commons trap appears when shared resources — [fisheries](https://gijn.org/stories/investigation-reveals-global-fisheries-already-collapsed/), roads, emergency services — are used by individuals in ways that degrade the whole. 

The 'commons' is a metaphor, coined by the economist **William Forster Lloyd** in 1833, describing a hypothetical shared piece of land on which cattle herders might allow their cows graze. As the ecologist **Garrett Hardin** [put it]([https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.162.3859.1243](https://math.uchicago.edu/~shmuel/Modeling/Hardin,%20Tragedy%20of%20the%20Commons.pdf)) in 1968, popularising the term:

> "Each man is locked into a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit – in a world that is limited. Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own best interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons. Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all."

## Examples of the tragedy of the commons

Unsurprisingly, most examples of this system trap come from environmental reporting. The 'commons' in question might be fish stocks, breathable air, usable water, fossil fuels, forests, or biodiversity. Examples include:

* Ian Urbina's [New York Times series](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/24/world/the-outlaw-ocean.html) and [book](https://theoutlawocean.com/book) *The Outlaw Ocean* reports on the impact on the 'commons' of the ocean of illegal fishing and a lack of regulation (as well as other impacts including labour exploitation).
* Breathable air is the commons involved in coverage of Delhi's ranking as the most polluted capital city in the world. This tragedy was, [according to one report](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-68613502), due to "rapid industrialisation coupled with weak enforcement of environmental laws"
* NPR's reporting relates to the 'commons' of groundwater: *[Without Enough Water To Go Around, Farmers In California Are Exhausting Aquifers](https://www.npr.org/2021/07/22/1019483661/without-enough-water-to-go-around-farmers-in-california-are-exhausting-aquifers)*
* And Mongabay's [reporting on the Amazon rainforest](https://news.mongabay.com/list/amazon-rainforest/) covers a range of tragedies, from illegal mining and oil and gas extraction to logging and illegal settlers.

Outside of environmental issues, there are examples in health and justice:

* The BBC looks at "[How we can stop antibiotic resistance](https://www.bbc.co.uk/future/article/20170607-how-we-can-stop-antibiotic-resistance)", a tragedy caused by overuse of antibiotics in both humans and animals
* Public health services are a common resource that can suffer from overuse, forming the basis of stories like [Undercover A&E: NHS in Crisis](https://www.channel4.com/programmes/undercover-ae-nhs-in-crisis-dispatches) and [The 10 'longest' hospital delays exposed](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-38896155)
* The Globe and Mail looked at "[How Canada’s FOI system broke under its own weight](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-canada-freedom-of-information-laws/)"
* "Cuts to legal aid have created "deserts" of provision across England and Wales", a [BBC investigation found](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46357169)

In non-environmental stories it is important to recognise that a resource's limits may be set by political or financial decisions, such as reduced funding for hospitals and staff, or for other parts of the system. The scale of "[Bed blocking](https://fullfact.org/health/bed-blocking-what-it-and-it-paralysing-nhs/)" or "[stranded patients](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/12/number-of-healthy-patients-stranded-in-english-hospital-wards-rises-by-80)" for example, may not be because more people are getting ill, but because of a reduction in hospital beds, and in hospitals' inability to release patients due to a lack of social care facilities. 


* [*Science*'s investigation into fisheries](https://gijn.org/stories/investigation-reveals-global-fisheries-already-collapsed/) "tested how accurate estimates of fish stocks actually are" (monitoring).
* Daniel Wizenberg's reporting on cruise ship pollution [reports on ports considering bans and restrictions](https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/oct/19/europe-ports-bear-brunt-of-cruise-ship-pollution) (punishments) and ["a divide among residents about the benefits and drawbacks of tourism"](https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/small-arctic-village-where-tourists-are-replacing-narwhals-spanish) (the balance of costs and benefits).

A story about the increasing demands being placed on A&E services might similarly focus on boundaries (e.g. patients using A&E instead of other services) and relationships.

- **What to look for**: Unregulated or poorly monitored access to a shared resource. Growing use without growing responsibility.
- **Questions to ask**: Who uses the resource? Who monitors it? Are there rules — and do they work?

![Political economist Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize in Economics for her research into how communities successfully manage commons. She identifies eight 'pressure points'.](https://www.solvingforpattern.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Ostrom-design-principles.png)  
*Adapted here by [Howard Silverman](https://www.solvingforpattern.org/2013/07/17/making-the-practice-turn-the-active-voice/).*

A potential story on this system failure might draw on political scientist **Elinor Ostrom**'s eight pressure points to look in the following areas:

- What are the **boundaries**? Who counts as a “user” or stakeholder?
- Is the system being **monitored**? If so, by whom?
- Who has **decision-making power** — and is it legitimate?
- Are rules being **broken or gamed**, and if so, how are they enforced?
- What does the **conflict resolution process** look like — or is it missing?
- Are **local voices** recognised — or excluded?

Source: https://www.economicsonline.co.uk/definitions/untitled-7.html/ : "Common goods (common resources) are the second type of quasi-public goods. They are non-excludable and rival. An example of this kind of good is a meadow for grazing cattle; anyone is free to use the meadow (non-excludable), but one person's usage of the meadow reduces the amount left for use by others (rival)."
