# The tragedy of the commons



This trap appears when shared resources — [fisheries](https://gijn.org/stories/investigation-reveals-global-fisheries-already-collapsed/), roads, emergency services — are used by individuals in ways that degrade the whole.

- **What to look for**: Unregulated or poorly monitored access to a shared resource. Growing use without growing responsibility.
- **Questions to ask**: Who uses the resource? Who monitors it? Are there rules — and do they work?

A potential story on this system failure might draw on political scientist **Elinor Ostrom**'s eight pressure points to look in the following areas:

- What are the **boundaries**? Who counts as a “user” or stakeholder?
- Is the system being **monitored**? If so, by whom?
- Who has **decision-making power** — and is it legitimate?
- Are rules being **broken or gamed**, and if so, how are they enforced?
- What does the **conflict resolution process** look like — or is it missing?
- Are **local voices** recognised — or excluded?

[*Science*'s investigation into fisheries](https://gijn.org/stories/investigation-reveals-global-fisheries-already-collapsed/), for example, "tested how accurate estimates of fish stocks actually are" (monitoring). Daniel Wizenberg's reporting on cruise ship pollution [reports on ports considering bans and restrictions](https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/oct/19/europe-ports-bear-brunt-of-cruise-ship-pollution) (punishments) and ["a divide among residents about the benefits and drawbacks of tourism"](https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/small-arctic-village-where-tourists-are-replacing-narwhals-spanish) (the balance of costs and benefits).

A story about the increasing demands being placed on A&E services might similarly focus on boundaries (e.g. patients using A&E instead of other services) and relationships.
