# System traps: what they are, and what journalists can learn from them

At its best, journalism can act as a vital check to stop systems going wrong. But how do we recognise **systemic problems** — and report on those?

Donella Meadows’s *Thinking in Systems* offers one particularly useful framework: eight common **“system traps”** where systems fail to meet their objectives, get caught in negative feedback loops, or produce unintended consequences.

Knowing these traps can help you more quickly identify the nature of a systemic problem, the causes to focus your reporting on, and what questions to ask regarding solutions.

Here are the traps with links to the pages on each:

1. **[Fixes that fail](policyresistance.md)** (also known as policy resistance) are traps where policies just don’t seem to work — or actively make things worse. Think of the ‘war on drugs’ or health reforms that lead to longer waiting lists. Investigations here often involve asking: what goals are in conflict?

2. The **[tragedy of the commons](tragedyofthecommons.md)** is a well-known problem, when shared resources — from fisheries to emergency services — are overused or abused, and everyone suffers. This trap provides a structure for reporting on degraded environments, overstretched systems, or poorly regulated access.

3. **Eroding goals** (also called drift to low performance or the boiled frog trap) sees standards slipping gradually until dysfunction becomes the norm. In education and healthcare, this shows up in grade inflation, raised thresholds for support, or weakened protections.

4. **Escalation** traps will be familiar from stories on "arms races" or "races to the bottom" where actors compete to outdo or undercut each other, triggering a spiral. These stories include competition around spending or technology, algorithm-driven polarisation, price wars, or where tax or regulation gets increasingly reduced.

5. **[Success to the successful](successtosuccessful.md)** sees the rich get richer, and the powerful more powerful. It’s a feedback loop that appears in monopolies, but also sport, private education and unequal health systems, despite rules designed to ensure fair competition.

6. **Shifting the burden to the intervenor**: this is the trap of addiction to short-term fixes — like subsidies, outsourcing or punitive enforcement — instead of tackling root causes. Examples include cheap energy and credit or the use of police and prisons as short-term fixes for mental health and addiction problems. Stories in this category often question whether interventions are masking deeper failures or tougher choices.

7. **Rule beating**: legal loopholes, workarounds, and technicalities that break the spirit of the rules while staying on the right side of the law. From tax avoidance to 'gaming the system' to get funding, this is classic investigative territory.

8. **[Seeking the wrong goal](wronggoal.md)**: when metrics distort what matters, performance indicators become perverse incentives. Whether it’s hospitals prioritising targets over patients or schools ‘off-rolling’ students to boost grades, these are stories where the numbers don’t tell the whole truth.
