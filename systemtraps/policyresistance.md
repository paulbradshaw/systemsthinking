# Policy resistance

***[In the first of a series on system traps](https://onlinejournalismblog.com/tag/system-traps/), I look at why policy resistance provides a regular source of stories for journalists, how to spot these stories quicker, and what questions to ask to report it better.***

Why wasn’t the war on drugs ever won? Why do healthcare reforms so often backfire? These are classic **policy resistance** stories, where different parts of a system pull in opposite directions.

Policy resistance is perhaps the most visible ‘system failure’ — it's lurking in stories in every day. But recognising it means we know what questions to ask, and what to look for.

- **What to look for**: Reforms, policies or guidelines that don’t work, or make things worse. Outcomes that stay stubbornly the same. Reforms being delayed or watered down. Newly announced policies and reactions to those
- **Questions to ask**: Who has a different goal within the system? Is one part of the system cancelling out another? What lobbying is taking place, and where? How do the policymakers expect it play out, and how does that compare with reality?

## Examples of policy resistance

In environmental policy we can see lots of these tensions - for example, between reforms aimed at reducing emissions or pollution and policies aimed at increasing production, consumption or employment. Conversely, policies for housebuilding, or green energy projects, might conflict with policies for protecting green spaces or animal habitats. 

The failure of the war on drugs is one of the best examples to explore to understand how a policy can fail to consider the competing goals of those in a system. As [one analysis puts it](https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/four-decades-counting-continued-failure-war-drugs), prohibition "acts as a “tax” on sellers in the drug market", raising costs and promoting "cartelization" (another system trap, '**success to the successful**'). The addition costs also lead "sellers to create, transport, and sell more potent materials because prohibition’s added costs incentivize higher-potency drugs and their higher value per unit.

> "For example, under prohibition, suppliers will tend to offer heroin compared to marijuana, since heroin is more valuable per unit ... Likewise, drug dealers will tend to sell more potent versions of all drugs. For instance, someone selling marijuana will likely provide a product with higher concentrations of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive component of marijuana, as they can earn more money per unit.

At the same time the cost of engaging in criminal activity is lowered, because fellow criminals are unlikely to report crimes, and incentives for using violence are increased, because it reinforces market control. "It follows that the prohibition of drugs may be the primary cause of crime in the drug market, not the physical effects of use."

Drug users, meanwhile "rationally respond to risk and look to maximize their satisfaction or high from every dollar spent.

> "First, users will likely switch from lower potency to higher potency within a given type of drug ... Second, users may switch from low-potency drugs to harder drugs (such as from marijuana to cocaine). Third, users are likely to employ ingestion methods that increase the effectiveness of drugs (such as injecting rather than smoking a drug). Taken together, these information and potency effects mean that prohibition likely increases drug overdoses [and disease transmission]."

The result, then, of policy resistance is often various **unintended consequences**, any of which can be reported on and investigated. In addition to those detailed above, for example, the war on drugs contributed to a rise in incarceration, police militarisation, racial bias and tensions, and corruption of public officials. Internationally, "the U.S. government has continually adopted policies that have been counterproductive to its broader stated goals, including major U.S. initiatives like nation building and counterterrorism."


## How to find policy resistance stories

Daily news reporting is full of policy stories, which means plenty of potential leads for follow-up stories on policy resistance. Just flicking through one day's newspaper identifies the following:

- [Calls for a wealth tax](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx242gw70x7o)
- [Aid distribution policy in Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/31/the-mathematics-of-starvation-how-israel-caused-a-famine-in-gaza)
- [Government vows 'major crackdown' on people smuggling gangs](https://news.sky.com/story/100m-border-security-boost-as-govt-vows-major-crackdown-on-people-smuggling-gangs-13406163)
- [Government announces a new programme to "revive family services across the country and improve early years provision"](https://lgiu.org/briefing/how-can-local-authorities-best-deliver-the-governments-new-programme-for-early-years-provision/)
- [China-backed centres at UK universities under threat from new free speech laws](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/aug/01/china-backed-centres-at-uk-universities-under-threat-from-new-free-speech-laws)
- A report calling for parents' instinct to be taken into account as part of guidance on medical diagnosis
- An activist says British police asked her to "avoid attending public gatherings" as part of their safeguarding processes/tactics (the policy's stated goal is to keep someone safe, but this conflicts with the individual's goal to participate in protest)

We can classify these stories into three broad types:

1. Stories about *proposed* policies (a wealth tax, medical guidelines)
2. Stories about *established* policies (safeguarding processes)
3. Stories about *new* policies (new free speech laws, aid distribution)

## Stories about proposed policies: seek out those with different goals

With proposed policies the attention is on those doing to proposing: politicians calling for a new tax, or a report calling for new guidelines. 

Follow-up stories might seek out those with different goals to the policy's stated goals, or those with expertise on those forces. For example:

* A wealth tax has the stated goal of raising revenue for public services. But those likely to be targeted by the tax may have goals that conflict with that (such as a goal to maximise wealth). What might they do in seeking their own goals that undermines the policy's goals?
* The political party itself has other goals, including raising money to campaign and win elections. If donors are likely to be affected by the wealth tax, there is another potential conflict.
* Campaigners want parents' instincts to be taken into account in guidelines - but unions might want to reduce the workloads of doctors and nurses, and the government may want to reduce waiting lists

Look for evidence of **lobbying** by those who would be affected by such policies. Good places to look include records of politicians' meetings and minutes from those; political donations; submissions to consultations and inquiries; PR tactics. **Freedom of Information** laws can be useful in accessing some of this information.

## Stories about new policies: look for pushback, negotiation and change

Resistance can be especially visible when policies are introduced, and this may be the moment where a new policy is delayed, watered down, not fully enforced, or exemptions agreed. 

The story *[China-backed centres at UK universities under threat from new free speech laws](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/aug/01/china-backed-centres-at-uk-universities-under-threat-from-new-free-speech-laws)* is a good example:

> "Universities fear that the new regulations imposed by the Office for Students (OfS) this month will cause legal headaches with their Chinese partners, including the government in Beijing, and could lead to some being closed ... university leaders said they have asked the OfS for more time to investigate and negotiate with their partners. A spokesperson for the OfS said: 'Any institution not meeting their free speech obligations should take urgent action.'"

There is clear potential here for the policy to be less effective than anticipated, and an investigation to shine a spotlight on how it is failing, or has failed. 

A simple option here is to make a diary note - in six months or a year, for example - to check what happened in the end. Another option is to contact the stakeholders involved to report on how the situation is developing. Again, it is worth looking for evidence of **lobbying** and using **Freedom of Information** laws to find out how public bodies are responding to the concerns being raised.

## Stories about established policies: look for a lack of change, or unintended (or intended) consequences

One of the simplest ways to identify and reveal fixes that fail is the ‘**lack of change**‘ story: once a policy has been in place for a long enough period, investigate if it seems to be working. Use data to spot where a system is resisting its own policy, or use an **anniversary** to ask 'What Good Is It Doing For Us?', as [NPR did of the war on drugs](https://www.npr.org/2021/06/17/1006495476/after-50-years-of-the-war-on-drugs-what-good-is-it-doing-for-us).

For example, the policy to introduce tuition fees in the UK university system was [intended](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/14782103221136167) to create a market where universities competed on cost - but this didn't happen. That lack of change was a strong lead to investigate why. Understanding that this was likely a 'policy resistance' system trap helps to focus that investigation on the goals of stakeholders (universities' objectives were to maintain market prestige and maximise funding; students' goals are not merely financial), and experts in the dynamics of competition ([competition alone is not enough to drive prices down](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/businessreview/2017/10/18/do-uk-universities-collude-in-ways-that-inhibit-genuine-competition/)). Introducing competition in the health system is a [similar example](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/healthcare-competition-saves-lives).

Some of the most important investigative journalism has highlighted the unintended consequences of policies. The 2024 winner of the [IRE Medal for Outstanding Crime Reporting](https://www.ire.org/announcing-the-2024-ire-award-winners-and-finalists/), [“Tráileres, Trampa para Migrantes”](https://www.telemundo.com/noticias/noticias-telemundo/inmigracion/migrants-trailers-mexico-us-rcna150313) (Cargo Trucks: A Trap for Migrants) is about policy resistance in immigration. Finalist [“Fields of Green: Chinese Mafias and the U.S. Black Market for Marijuana"](https://www.propublica.org/series/fields-of-green) "uncovered how marijuana legalization in Oklahoma has opened up opportunities for organized crime". Injustice Watch's story *[Tenants’ right to withhold rent becomes landlords’ weapon](https://www.injusticewatch.org/project/tenant-trap/2024/withhold-rent-tenant-rights/)* exposes how a law intended to protect tenants led to retaliation and eviction. 

Emma Graham-Harrison's front-page report *[The mathematics of starvation: how Israel caused a famine in Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/31/the-mathematics-of-starvation-how-israel-caused-a-famine-in-gaza)* is a striking example of exposing how the reality of a policy's execution can differ from its stated aims:

> "As Gaza has slid into famine this summer, Israeli officials have variously denied the existence of mass starvation, claimed without evidence that Hamas steals and hoards aid, or blamed hunger on UN distribution failures, sharing pictures of aid pallets awaiting collection inside the border.
> 
> "Yet data compiled and published by Israel’s own government makes clear that it has been starving Gaza. Between March and June, Israel allowed just 56,000 tonnes of food to enter the territory, Cogat records show, less than a quarter of Gaza’s minimum needs for that period.
>
> "Even if every bag of UN flour had been collected and handed out, and the GHF had developed safe systems for equitable distribution, starvation was inevitable. Palestinians did not have enough to eat."

The article **sticks to the facts** (including what various organisations have said): it does not have evidence of intention. Data only tells you what is happening, not why, but it allows you to ask that question. 

What the article cleverly does is cut through the claims and counter-claims and asks a simple "What if?": "What if none of the problems being blamed existed? What if all the aid reached its destination? Would that be enough to achieve its objectives?"

Once it has been established that the objectives could never be met, the next step is to look at why. Are there competing goals - for example between humanitarian and military aims? Or are the real goals political (e.g. to maintain external support), rather than those stated (i.e. the humanitarian goals)? Where would evidence of those goals be found? Perhaps in internal documents or minutes of meetings, perhaps through interviews with those involved about what conversations have taken place. This might be focused in particular on periods where strategies changed (e.g. when the amount of aid being supplied changed). The key thing is that an awareness of the system trap provides a clear focus for what research and questions are seeking to establish.
