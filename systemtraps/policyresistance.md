# Policy resistance

***[In the first of a series on system traps](https://onlinejournalismblog.com/tag/system-traps/), I look at why policy resistance provides a regular source of stories for journalists, how to spot these stories quicker, and what questions to ask to report it better.***

Why wasn’t the war on drugs ever won? Why do healthcare reforms so often backfire? These are classic **policy resistance** stories, where different parts of a system pull in opposite directions.

Policy resistance is perhaps the most visible ‘system failure’ — but recognising it means we know what questions to ask, and what to look for.

- **What to look for**: Reforms that don’t work, or make things worse. Outcomes that stay stubbornly the same.
- **Questions to ask**: Who has a different goal within the system? Is one part of the system cancelling out another?

## Examples of policy resistance

In environmental policy we can see the tensions between reducing emissions and policies aimed at increasing production, consumption or employment.

One of the simplest ways to identify and reveal fixes that fail is the ‘**lack of change**‘ story: once a policy has been in place for a long enough period, investigate if it seems to be working. Use data to spot where a system is resisting its own policy.

Another story is to look for **unintended consequences**. 


## How to find policy resistance stories

Daily news reporting is full of policy stories, which means plenty of potential leads for follow-up stories on policy resistance. Just flicking through one day's newspaper identifies the following:

- Calls for a wealth tax  
- Aid distribution policy in Gaza  
- Nurses reject a pay offer
- [China-backed centres at UK universities under threat from new free speech laws](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/aug/01/china-backed-centres-at-uk-universities-under-threat-from-new-free-speech-laws)
- A report calling for parents' instinct to be taken into account as part of guidance on medical diagnosis
- An activist says British police asked her to "avoid attending public gatherings" as part of their safeguarding processes/tactics (the policy's stated goal is to keep someone safe, but this conflicts with the individual's goal to participate in protest)

We can classify these stories into three broad types:

1. Stories about *proposed* policies (a wealth tax, medical guidelines)
2. Stories about *established* policies (safeguarding processes)
3. Stories about *new* policies (new free speech laws, aid distribution)

## Stories about proposed policies: seek out those with different goals

With proposed policies the attention is on those doing to proposing: politicians calling for a new tax, or a report calling for new guidelines. 

Follow-up stories might seek out those with different goals to the policy's stated goals, or those with expertise on those forces. For example:

* A wealth tax has the stated goal of raising revenue for public services. But those likely to be targeted by the tax may have goals that conflict with that (such as a goal to maximise wealth). What might they do in seeking their own goals that undermines the policy's goals?
* The political party itself has other goals, including raising money to campaign and win elections. If donors are likely to be affected by the wealth tax, there is another potential conflict.
* Campaigners want parents' instincts to be taken into account in guidelines - but unions might want to reduce the workloads of doctors and nurses, and the government may want to reduce waiting lists

Look for evidence of **lobbying** by those who would be affected by such policies. Good places to look include records of politicians' meetings and minutes from those; political donations; submissions to consultations and inquiries; PR tactics. **Freedom of Information** laws can be useful in accessing some of this information.

## Stories about new policies: look for pushback, negotiation and change

Resistance can be especially visible when policies are introduced, and this may be the moment where a new policy is delayed, watered down, not fully enforced, or exemptions agreed. 

The story *[China-backed centres at UK universities under threat from new free speech laws](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/aug/01/china-backed-centres-at-uk-universities-under-threat-from-new-free-speech-laws)* is a good example:

> "Universities fear that the new regulations imposed by the Office for Students (OfS) this month will cause legal headaches with their Chinese partners, including the government in Beijing, and could lead to some being closed ... university leaders said they have asked the OfS for more time to investigate and negotiate with their partners. A spokesperson for the OfS said: 'Any institution not meeting their free speech obligations should take urgent action.'"

There is clear potential here for the policy to be less effective than anticipated, and an investigation to shine a spotlight on how it is failing, or has failed. 

A simple option here is to make a diary note - in six months or a year, for example - to check what happened in the end. Another option is to contact the stakeholders involved to report on how the situation is developing. Again, it is worth looking for evidence of **lobbying** and using **Freedom of Information** laws to find out how public bodies are responding to the concerns being raised.

## Stories about established policies: look for unintended consequences

Some of the most important investigative journalism highlights the unintended consequences of policies. The failure of the 'war on drugs' policy, for example, led to many [communities being scarred](https://www.npr.org/2021/06/17/1006495476/after-50-years-of-the-war-on-drugs-what-good-is-it-doing-for-us). The increase in orphans and [orphanages in Romania in the 1980s and 90s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980s%E2%80%931990s_Romanian_orphans_phenomenon) is another example, the result of a policy whose intention was to increase birth rates.
