# Policy resistance

***[In the first of a series on system traps](https://onlinejournalismblog.com/tag/system-traps/), I look at why policy resistance provides a regular source of stories for journalists, how to spot these stories quicker, and what questions to ask to report it better.***

Why wasn’t the war on drugs ever won? Why do healthcare reforms so often backfire? These are classic **policy resistance** stories, where different parts of a system pull in opposite directions.

Policy resistance is perhaps the most visible ‘system failure’ — but recognising it means we know what questions to ask, and what to look for.

- **What to look for**: Reforms that don’t work, or make things worse. Outcomes that stay stubbornly the same.
- **Questions to ask**: Who has a different goal within the system? Is one part of the system cancelling out another?

## How to find policy resistance stories

Daily news reporting is full of policy stories, which means plenty of potential leads for follow-up stories on policy resistance. Just flicking through one day's newspaper identifies the following:

- Calls for a wealth tax  
- Aid distribution policy in Gaza  
- Nurses reject a pay offer
- [China-backed centres at UK universities under threat from new free speech laws](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/aug/01/china-backed-centres-at-uk-universities-under-threat-from-new-free-speech-laws)

Some of these examples involve considering who might have different goals to the policy's stated goals. For example:

* A wealth tax has the stated goal of raising revenue for public services. But those likely to be targeted by the tax may have goals that conflict with that (such as a goal to maximise wealth). What might they do in seeking their own goals that undermines the policy's goals?
* The political party itself has other goals, including raising money to campaign and win elections. If donors are likely to be affected by the wealth tax, there is another potential conflict.

Some examples involve identifying potential conflicts of goals. For example, [China-backed centres at UK universities under threat from new free speech laws](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/aug/01/china-backed-centres-at-uk-universities-under-threat-from-new-free-speech-laws):

> "Universities fear that the new regulations imposed by the Office for Students (OfS) this month will cause legal headaches with their Chinese partners, including the government in Beijing, and could lead to some being closed ... university leaders said they have asked the OfS for more time to investigate and negotiate with their partners. A spokesperson for the OfS said: “Any institution not meeting their free speech obligations should take urgent action."

Such conflict could lead to the policy being watered down or delayed. 

## Examples of policy resistance

In environmental policy we can see the tensions between reducing emissions and policies aimed at increasing production, consumption or employment.

One of the simplest ways to identify and reveal fixes that fail is the ‘**lack of change**‘ story: once a policy has been in place for a long enough period, investigate if it seems to be working. Use data to spot where a system is resisting its own policy.

Another story is to look for **unintended consequences**. The increase in orphans and [orphanages in Romania in the 1980s and 90s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980s%E2%80%931990s_Romanian_orphans_phenomenon) is one example (the unintended consequence of a policy whose intention was to increase birth rates); communities [scarred](https://www.npr.org/2021/06/17/1006495476/after-50-years-of-the-war-on-drugs-what-good-is-it-doing-for-us) by the war on drugs is another.
