# Seeking the wrong goal

Sometimes it's not that goals create perverse incentives, but that an organisation or system doesn't focus on the bigger picture. Jane Haynes's [reporting on children's homes](https://insidebirmingham.substack.com/p/vulnerable-kids-went-missing-and) includes a particularly good example of this. After the publication of inspection reports [found](https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/exposed-chaotic-private-childrens-homes-32123377) poor living conditions, untrained staff, "a total breakdown of safeguarding [and] worst of all the young people faced clear risks to their wellbeing", she got a response from company director and co-owner Rob Finney.“Our focus is on addressing Ofsted requirements and making improvements," he said.

>  "Together, we have worked collaboratively with Ofsted. The Coventry and Sandwell homes have already been revisited by Ofsted, who are satisfied that all compliance requirements have now been met."

Jane notes: 

> "Note that the responses don’t mention children once. The company seems to care a lot about meeting Ofsted’s requirements - after all, it relies on a good or outstanding rating to secure contracts - and doesn’t seem remotely embarrassed about failing children. That’s worrying."
